## Description:
The goal of this project is to construct a simulator of boat activities. The boats are assumed to be inside or outside of a grid of N x N pixels, which is further divided into subregions.

### Simulation Mechanism: 
- Time driven mechanism
- Grid size
- Boats' initial location
- Type of activity
- Simulation duration be the event that two boats are "too close to each other" or a specific boat is in a specific subregion of grid
- Trajectory of the boats

### Boat activities include:
1. Boat X is folowwing boat Y
2. Boat X is chasing boat Y
3. Boat X is circling boat Y
4. Boat Y and boat Z are approaching each other
